## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**Four card feature section** is a static responsive website developed using "HTML" and "CSS". It consists of positioning and styling four cards using grid layout. The challenge involves both desktop and mobile version and it is a site based on Mobile First. I have tried to build it as closest to the design requirmenet provided in the challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
