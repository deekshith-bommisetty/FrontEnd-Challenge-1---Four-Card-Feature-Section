# FrontEnd Challenge - Four Card Feature Section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**Four card feature section** is a static responsive website developed using 'HTML' and 'CSS'. It consists of positioning and styling four cards using grid layout. The challenge involves both desktop and mobile version and this site is based on Mobile First. I have tried to build it as closest to the design requirmenet provided in the challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
